title: The OME UX Team. Part 3 - Mock-ups and Implementation in Stages
categories: user-experience

*By Gus Ferguson*

Along with the changes that had been requested, the UX team also wanted to:

- make it easier to see the rendering settings saved by other users, which was previously pretty well hidden in the UI, 
- improve the layout and availability of the rendering settings controls and 
- at the same time bring the UIs for this functionality in both the clients into line.

Mock-ups of the proposed changes to the UI are done using screenshots and mocked-up elements in Omnigraffle, allowing the team to visualise what the changes will look like and discuss improvements. The mock-ups follow the actions of the user carrying out tasks using the proposed UI allowing any issues or problems to become readily apparent. They also ensure that all steps in workflows can be carried out using the new interface and all user requirements are met.

The Preview Pane in the first round of mock-ups is shown below. The various controls and elements are practically the same as before, but the thumbnails representing settings saved by different users are exposed by default, with the image owner’s settings displayed in the Preview image by default. The team then did the first round of reviewing of the mock-ups.

The screenshots just show the OMERO.insight versions of the mock-ups because the ones for OMERO.web are essentially the same.

The reviews and feedback on the mock-ups by the team were collated and the suggestions included in new versions of the mock-up. For example, everyone wanted blue boxes highlighting the selected settings.

*Blue highlights!*

And we realised we also had to scope all the relevant contextual menus.

*Contextual menus.*

##First Round

At that particular stage in the development cycle, the team was close to a scheduled release, so there was not a lot of time to fit in this new functionality. Therefore the implementation for the version 5.0.6 release was limited to exposing the saved user settings as thumbnails, but in OMERO.insight only.

*Version 5.0.6 release.*

##Second Round

In the second round we decided to take the opportunity to rationalise and improve the controls and layout of the rendering settings panel. Various layouts were scoped out so the team could get a proper feel for them. You can see the playing of musical toolbars here.

*Different toolbar arrangements visualised.*

But the main point is that it takes mere seconds to change the layout in the mock-up so we can see what it looks like, as against the considerable mount of time and effort it takes for a developer to recode the UI, rebuild and show it to all of the team. This way the valuable developer time is not needlessly taken up with throw-away prototypes.

And here is the same process in OMERO.web, demonstrating the close alignment of this part of the UI in the two clients at this stage.

*The toolbar arrangements in the OMERO.web UI.*

Then, when the team has discussed all the options and decided on the way forward, the developers proceed with the coding, using the agreed mock-ups as the specification for layout of the controls and functionality.

So we now had the rest of what we had scoped out ready for release with version 5.1.0.

*OMERO.insight and OMERO.web UIs for the 5.1.0 release.*

But when we showed it to some users for feedback, they looked at it and said “all very nice”, but don’t forget we want to be able to save multiple rendering settings for each user for each image. So ...

##Third Round

... back to the drawing board.

<img src="/images/state-9.png" alt="Mock-ups of multiple rendering settings per user per image." style="width: 600px;"/>

*Multiple rendering settings per user.*

Yes, but no. They liked that, but wanted to be able to give each setting a unique name.

So we needed to add editing buttons and dialogue boxes.

*Let them have names!*

And this will hopefully be implemented in the next round of UI improvements.

Another important advantage with this workflow is that with all the scoping done well in advance of actual implementation, it helps to avoid conflict with other changes in the pipeline. So now if another change is muted that affects the Preview pane, Full Viewer or rendering settings, it is relatively easy to make sure that it fits in with these changes.

##Release

The UX team’s job doesn’t end with code implementation, as we don’t just abandon the user at this stage. With the OME’s continuous integration development system, the code, the developer documentation and the User Help are all updated and held in repositories ready for release.

So when all the testing is complete and everyone’s happy, The Big Red Button is pushed and the version release of all the elements is done at once. 

<img src="/images/release.png" alt="Image showing the release download page, developer documentation and User Help." style="width: 600px;"/>

*Similtaneous release of all elements.*

The benefits to the team of this coordination using the continuous integration and release system have been huge, making the testing and review of updates as painless as humanly possible.

##Iterations Count

The screenshot below represents some of the scoping exercises the team has undertaken in the last three years - 32 separate scoping exercise so far. Some, like  number 4 - Tagging, have up to nine versions of iteration.

*The extent of the scoping work and iterations.*

Once a scoped feature has been implemented, we record screenshots of the released version and add them to the scoping section of the team Google Drive as a record of the final implementation.

##In Summary

So while I admit user-centred design is not always the easiest road to travel in small, expert system developments, it still gives good results. As we have pressed on with this approach, we have seen much more positive feedback, with a greater number of users engaging with, and participating in, the development process. An indication of the effectiveness of the approach can be seen by the feedback from users being much more about how we could add to or enhance functionality rather than being mainly about issues with the behaviour, or mis-behaviour, of the user interface.

Our key aim is to try and identify and sort out issues and problems on paper during the design process before committing our limited resources of developer time to coding. Done properly, a few rounds of wrangling by the team at the design stage, can save weeks of pain and suffering at the implementation and testing stages. 

Visualisation of the problem and potential solutions is really the key to all of this, be it sketches, mock-ups or paper prototypes. The devil is in the detail and often the only way to hunt it out is to put it all down in black and white and make sure it works before the coding starts.

One way you know when you have succeeded is when a user looks at the new feature and says - “you see it was really simple – why did it take you so long to do it that way”. They don’t see all the sweat, blood on the walls, the hundreds of rejected solutions and the hammering out of every little detail that went into that final implementation.

And that’s probably the way it should be.
