title: The OME UX Team. Part 2 - The OME-UX Development Workflow
categories: user-experience

*By Gus Ferguson*

In this post we will run through a real workflow that has been done over the last few releases of OMERO.

The diagram below outlines our day-to-day pragmatic approach to developing.

##Requirements Gathering

Most of the UX team work starts with requirements in some form or another. This can range from a formal request through our forums or mailing lists to informal requests from users at meetings or even people sidling up at a conference and telling us they need OMERO to do the next big thing.

The requirement can often be a single use-case from a bench scientist, ranging from a simple task through to a large, complex workflow. This can be entirely new or a request for enhancement (RFE) of an existing workflow or piece of functionality. Commonly, the requirement is specific to a relatively small number of users, and they are often very busy people and may be located in many different parts of the world.

This means it can be a challenge spending enough time with a wide enough range of users to ensure the requirements are not too narrow and generalise enough so that they adequately represent the widest range of user tasks and use cases possible. However we generally find that once people are on board they are very generous with their time and expertise.

##Client Group Meetings

Our workflow revolves around our Client Group meetings where members of the team present requirements, talk through issues and present the results of any scoping for feedback. And this is where we usually relive the classic tussle between conceptual and functional designs.

The traditional approach is that, at the conceptual design stage, it’s all blue-sky, open-ended, ideal-world thinking. The idea is not to close off any avenues at an early stage and instead try and think about what the system should really do and how it should really work. All fluffy, cuddly and cute.

*The ideal of conceptual to functional design.*

Then you traditionally progress to functional design which is the reality of how it will all be done – the nuts and bolts of it. Well that is the traditional view ...

... the reality is usually more like this - but it shouldn’t stop you trying!

Despite this, keeping that open mind and idealism going for as long as possible in the process is very productive.

We are often faced with the prospect of a fairly daunting amount of change to the system to address some of the more complex requirements requested. The UX team has found it works well to see if there is a way of chunking the proposed changes into smaller steps. 

This makes it easier across the board, but particularly when it comes to evaluation of the changes we will need to make to the back end and the clients, enabling us to estimate the time and resources needed to get them done more accurately. In addition, the developers can often find the time to slip in a few smaller changes when they have a bit of slack, but would probably never find the time needed to do the whole tranche of work required all in one go. A spin-off of this is that the smaller step-wise evolution in the user interface is less disruptive to users with established workflows.

The OME UX team process is best illustrated by running through a real workflow that we have done over the last few releases of OMERO.

##Sharing Rendering Settings

The image below shows an image displayed in the full viewer of OMERO.insight version 5.0.5, with the rendering settings pane to the right. There are similar controls in the Preview pane of the Data Manager window in OMERO.insight and the same in OMERO.web. 

Users can choose to view or hide channels, and use the sliders to adjust the minimum and maximum pixel intensities for each channel. Then when they are happy with the appearance of the image, they save their rendering settings to the server. They can do this for both their own images and save their own settings for other user’s images, if they are in a group allowing collaboration.

In version 5.0.5, a user's own settings were shown by default, and then to see settings saved by any other users, they had to click on the “Saved by” button at the top right.

##User Requirements

The usability of this part of the UI was less than satisfactory as:

1. there is no way at all of seeing other user’s settings in the OMERO.web UI 
2. we had been asked by users to show the image owner’s rendering settings by default, rather than the current user’s, and
3. we had a few RFEs on the back burner for users to be able to save multiple rendering settings for each user.

As it was thought we could make a bit of space in the schedule, the rendering settings sharing UI was added to the priorities list.

Initially, a systematic survey of how the UIs currently handled setting and sharing of rendering settings was done and the results posted in a Google Drive document which everyone on the team has access to.

*Documenting the user requirements.*

Proposed changes to satisfy the user requirements were added.

*Suggestions for solutions.*

What also needs to be taken into account is the fact that there are likely to be some server-side and other back-end changes needed to support any new or changed functionality in the UIs. The team uses Trello to keep track of works in planning and progress. The image below shows just some of the cards on our Trello boards that relate to the proposed rendering settings display changes.

In response to feedback from the 2015 OME Users Meeting in Paris, the OME team now has [public Trello boards](https://trello.com/ome) that allow the community to see and contribute to the progress of active developments.

*The back-end overhead.*

After a number of iterations looking at the requirements, it was decided the following would be aimed at in the first instance:

- make it easier to see the rendering settings saved by other users, which was previously pretty hidden in the UI
- improve the layout and availability of the rendering settings controls
- bring both the clients into line.

So we did the first round of reviewing by the team.

The screenshots below show the state of the version 5.0.5 clients when we started. OMERO.insight is on the left and OMERO.web on the right. Although these show the rendering settings in the Preview pane, they were much the same as in the full viewer of OMERO.insight we saw before.
