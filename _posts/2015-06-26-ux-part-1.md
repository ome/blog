*By Gus Ferguson*

##Introduction

The User Experience (UX) Team works together across user support, training, design, prototyping and implementation of software in the Open Microscopy Environment. Most of the UX work relates to the areas traditionally covered by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

OMERO is the primary user-facing system, with two Graphical User Interface (GUI) clients and a Command Line Interface (CLI) client along with all the back-end server systems. The GUI clients are: 

- OMERO.insight - a Java-based multi-platform desktop client, and 
- OMERO.web - a browser based web application, built largely with Javascript. 

The two GUI clients do much the same things apart from importing and drawing Regions of Interest (ROIs), both of which Insight does but Web doesn’t. The two clients have come through very different development paths, so a lot of our UX focus in the last three years has been aligning the GUI clients when implementing new, or updating existing, functionality.

We are a large distributed team, so have to ensure that communication within the team is effective. In addition we draw on a wider group of users from lab scientists, through to image analysts, facility managers and developers who are part of the community. This gives us much greater scope when doing requirements gathering, task analysis and user testing.

We share common basic development aims with most teams producing software: deploy functional software that allows users to achieve their tasks, and has ease of use, learnability and robustness. Simple aims, but as all developers know, somewhat tricky to achieve.

The OME system is a classical example of an “academic expert system”, i.e. one designed by experts in a domain for use by other experts in that domain, and coming out of an academic environment. This is a very well trodden path and is well recognised in the UX/HCI community as having very particular issues and challenges associated with it. One of the biggest UX challenges with academic expert systems is getting from the old developer chestnut “it works for me ...” to the point where it also works for a broad range of users in a wide range of domains.

Developers may be doing this for altruistic reasons, spreading the joy of their software, or more pragmatic reasons, such as attracting grant funding. Either way, going from a narrow, constrained, tidy focus to a relatively open-ended, unconstrained environment can be quite daunting.

##Moving to a Broader User Base

The starting point is looking at who all the current and potential users are, working out how to get them on board, and then how to satisfy their requirements. This often involves considerable change in the user interface to enable non- or not-so-expert users to understand and use the software. The OME project established much of the groundwork drawing on the expertise of ethnographic-focused HCI specialists, and then forming the UX team within the project to carry through the work.

The primary users of OME are bench Life Scientists, but our user base has rapidly expanded to include digital pathology, teaching, publishing and a number of other domains. This expansion is continual and open-ended. But OME does not just have the people who use the clients, scientists and so on, as users, we also have facility managers and system administrators in institutions using OMERO. 

Then in addition to this, as an open source project, OME also effectively has a lot of other developers as users of the system. And to add another layer, being open source, this is very much a two-way street, so the developer-users are also part of the team as well as being users. A slightly tangled web but very fruitful if handled well!

The focus of this series of posts is on the scientist user and the GUI clients, OMERO.insight and OMERO.web, where the primary UX team involvement is. 

It may sound obvious, but the client GUI is the only way the majority of users have to interact with any computer system. No matter how wonderful the system is behind the scenes, the typical user only gets to use what they can see and interact with via the GUI. So in effect, the GUI ultimately determines the functionality of the software for most users.

In the case of OME, in its early days as an expert system, it enabled users to access functionality directly through its Application Program Interface (API) via scripts or the command line, so there is a huge legacy of functionality in the system that has never been exposed via the GUI clients. Therefore a key part of the UX team’s task is to identify and help incorporate new workflows into the GUIs that expose currently unavailable functionality, without significant disruption to any existing workflows.

The OME team is lucky to benefit from the broad range of backgrounds of its members, from experience as biological scientists, through facility management, medicine, maths  and physics. Direct experience of the domains in which the software is used helps enormously when dealing with users and understanding their requirements, tasks and workflows.

##User-Centred Development

There are a number of classical models of software development in the HCI world. OME probably comes closest to Hartson and Hix’s  Star Model, and although we have dabbled with Agile a bit, it is probably not the best model when there is no monolithic “customer” for the software. However, this is not the place to delve into the details of user-centred design, but rather just pick up a couple of points, then show the process used in OME.

The key to the UX approach is to make user-centred design pay in the long run by doing a number of good things: 

- saving developer time and effort
- avoiding mistakes and crossed wires
- preventing redundancy
- facilitating collaboration, and 
- enhancing documentation.

But actually the process does more! 

Mental models are central to the way humans think, view and build understanding of the world around them and they are especially important in the use of computer software. As a rule mental models are incomplete, unstable, nebulous and easily confused, as frequently described by [Donald Norman](http://www.jnd.org). Because user-centred design requires mental models to be captured and put down on paper and talked about explicitly, it forces the conversion of implicit knowledge into explicit knowledge, stabilising the mental models and clarifying ideas. 

Particularly important for OME is the fact that mostly expert knowledge is “deep knowledge”, i.e. it is tacit, not consciously articulated and often relatively abstract. By getting experts to articulate their knowledge, it is made implicit and concrete. Work done by the late Joan Bliss showed that making abstract knowledge explicit actually changes it, and this is what we see when extracting expert knowledge and mental models from expert users.

As expert knowledge is a special case of mental models, and with all the expert users and developers we have involved with OME, how it is handled is very important for us. Our key is to go back to the experts more than once to pick up the changes in their knowledge that happen after we have talked to them the first time. This is probably one of the main reasons why this particular facet of user-centred design really helps in expert system development. 

Another phenomenon of user-centred design is that the process serves to prime the developer’s thought processes and get them thinking about the problem long before they narrow down and focus on the nuts and bolts of the actual implementation. Therefore before they start coding, the developers have done a lot of pre-processing, firmed up their own mental models of the system, and filled in any gaps in their approach. As well as leading to an implementation that is likely to be close to an optimal solution, it can lead to real time-saving and efficient use of developer resources.

The next post, Part 2, will cover The OME-UX Development Workflow.
