Then merrily add some text using markdown e.g *this is italics*, **this is bold** and a link is formatted as [link text](http://yourlinkhere.html)

If you want titles within a post, headings are

#Top level

##Subtitle

###Another another level if needed

To add an image, save it into the image folder and then insert using
![alt text](/images/yourimage.png)

See a markdown guide such as [this one here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)
if you need further formatting help.

Or see [poole example content file](https://github.com/poole/poole/blob/master/_posts/2014-01-01-example-content.md)
for what types of more technical formatting are supported by this theme.
